# Sorting-Algorithms
This project focuses on showing the differences in performance in sorting problems based on what algorithms you use. 
The used algorithms are bubble-sort, insertion-sort, merge-sort and quick-sort. There is a screenshot added, which 
emphasizes on the actual performance results based on different sizes of files to be sorted.
